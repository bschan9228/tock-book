# Kernel Syscalls

[TODO] We need to determine what, if anything we want to have as a kernel 
implementation for the tutorial.

Potential ideas:
- convert temperature from C to F (somewhat trivial but would be a quick exposure to capsules?)
- some sort of MAC layer capsule changes? Not sure how effective this would be?
