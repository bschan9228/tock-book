# Tock Course

The Tock course includes several different modules that guide you through
various aspects of Tock and Tock applications. Each module is designed to be
fairly standalone such that a full course can be composed of different modules
depending on the interests and backgrounds of those doing the course. You should
be able to do the lessons that are of interest to you.

Each module begins with a description of the lesson, and then includes steps to
follow. The modules cover both programming in the kernel as well as
applications.
